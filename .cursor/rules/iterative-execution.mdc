# Iterative Task Execution Workflow

**This rule MUST be followed for every task.**

## Required Process

Before starting any task, read `docs/iterative-task-execution.md` completely. This document provides the complete 8-phase workflow.

## Key Requirements

1. **Never assume code works** - Always validate after every change
2. **Iterative development** - Make small changes, validate each one
3. **Test incrementally** - Test each piece as you build it
4. **Fix errors immediately** - Don't accumulate errors

## Validation After Every Change

After making ANY code change, you MUST:

```bash
# Type check
pnpm typecheck

# Lint check
pnpm lint

# Build affected package
pnpm --filter <package-name> build

# Test manually (start dev server, test in browser/API)
```

## Completion Criteria

A task is NOT complete until ALL of these are true:

- [ ] All code compiles without errors
- [ ] All linting passes
- [ ] All type checking passes
- [ ] Code has been manually tested
- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met
- [ ] No regressions introduced
- [ ] Build succeeds in production mode

## Reference

See `docs/iterative-task-execution.md` for the complete detailed workflow with all phases, checklists, and validation steps.
